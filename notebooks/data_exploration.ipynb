    "# Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. You'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, you'll apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you completed the first term of this program, you will be familiar with the first part of this project, from the unsupervised learning project. The versions of those two datasets used in this project will include many more features and has not been pre-cleaned. You are also free to choose whatever approach you'd like to analyzing the data rather than follow pre-determined steps. In your work on this project, make sure that you carefully document your steps and decisions, since your main deliverable for this project will be a blog post reporting your findings."
